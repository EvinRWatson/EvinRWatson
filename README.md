# Hello! 👋

## About Me! 😎

I am a passionate sofware engineer looking to drive innovation. As an Engineer for the Marine Corps I learned so many valuable life lessons and ways to
communicate, lead, and mentor my peers. Prior to the Marine Corps I learned programming in [Java](https://github.com/EvinRWatson/Java-Archive) through school and became inspired to be a self taught C++ programmer. 💾

One of my favorite small projects was when I wrote a program([newCalc](https://github.com/EvinRWatson/newCalc)) that will calculates explosive safety metrics for miltary munitions. This program saved time when planning for demolition training operations for my Marines. 🎇

Following the success of newCalc I was inspired to further my programming education post-service by attending the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy ([MSSA](https://military.microsoft.com/programs/microsoft-software-systems-academy/)), a Software Development Apprenticeship administered by Microsoft to help veterans land roles in tech. During MSSA I wrote my first large fullstack application called [Dominion Provisioning](https://github.com/EvinRWatson/DominionProvisioning), a service and inventory tracking software inspired by [GCSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Combat_Support_System), the software used in the U.S. Military to track maintenance and procurement. This project was my first foray into the SDLC and Cloud Computing, along with the technical aspects of .NET Framework, SQL, HTML, Bootstrap, etc. ♟

Currently I work at [ServiceCentral Technologies](https://servicecentral.com/) as a Software Engineer utlizing .NET to build high quality modular reverse-logistics & tracking software. 👨‍💻
