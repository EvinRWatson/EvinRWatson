### About Me! 😎

I am a passionate sofware engineer looking to drive innovation. As an Engineer for the Marine Corps I learned so many valuable life lessons about communication, leadership and mentoring. I started my programming journey with [Java](https://github.com/EvinRWatson/Java-Archive) during high-school which inspired me to teach myself C++ and progress on my own.

One of my favorite small projects was when I wrote a program called ([newCalc](https://github.com/EvinRWatson/newCalc)) which calculates explosive safety metrics for miltary munitions. This program saved time when planning for demolition training operations for my Marines. 🎇

Following the success of newCalc I was inspired to further my programming education post-service by attending the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy ([MSSA](https://military.microsoft.com/programs/microsoft-software-systems-academy/)). During the program I wrote my first large fullstack application called [Dominion Provisioning](https://github.com/EvinRWatson/DominionProvisioning), a service and inventory tracking software inspired by [GCSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Combat_Support_System), the software used in the U.S. Military to track maintenance and procurement. This project was my first foray into the Software Development Life Cycle and Cloud Computing, bringing together the technical aspects of technical aspects of .NET Framework, SQL, HTML, Bootstrap, etc. ♟
