# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me! ðŸ˜Ž
I am a software engineer on my journey to bring innovation to the world! As an Engineer for the Marine Corps I learned so many valuable life lessons and ways to
communicate, lead, and mentor my teammates. Prior to the Corps I learned Java through school and I was a self taught C++ programmer. ðŸ–¥

One of my favorite small projects was when I programmed a program that will calculate safe standoff for explosives under different conditions. This program saved time
when planning for demolition training operations for my Marines. [ðŸ’¥](https://github.com/EvinRWatson/newCalc)
