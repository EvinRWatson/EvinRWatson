# Hello! 👋

## About Me! 😎
I am a software engineer on my journey to bring innovation to the world! As an Engineer for the Marine Corps I learned so many valuable life lessons and ways to
communicate, lead, and mentor my teammates. Prior to the Corps I learned Java through school and I was a self taught C++ programmer. 🖥

Right now I am attending Microsoft's MSSA program to expand my cloud development knowledge using C#, SQL, Azure, ASP.NET, etc. 

One of my favorite small projects was when I programmed a program that will calculate safe standoff for explosives under different conditions. This program saved time
when planning for demolition training operations for my Marines. 💥

My goal is to be working on software and embedded systems for defence contractors and agencies in order to bring the highest quality of technological support to my 
brothers and sisters in arms. 💻

## Current Project 🤓
What I am working on right now is a inventory and maintenance management software called [Dominion Provisioning](https://github.com/EvinRWatson/DominionProvisioning).
The inspiration for this project was to be a more intuitive and easy to use version of the Global Combat Support System. Which is the logistics software used by the 
Army and Marine Corps. 🤖

### Fun Fact 😝
The human brain takes in 11 million bits of information every second but is aware of only 40! 🤯
