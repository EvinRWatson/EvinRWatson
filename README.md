# Hello! 👋

## About Me! 😎
I am a software engineer on my journey to bring innovation to the world! As an Engineer for the Marine Corps I learned so many valuable life lessons and ways to
communicate, lead, and mentor my teammates. Prior to the Corps I learned Java through school and I was a self taught C++ programmer. 🖥

Right now I am attending Microsoft's MSSA program to expand my cloud development knowledge using C#, SQL, ASP.NET, etc. 🖱 

One of my favorite small projects was when I programmed a program that will calculate safe standoff for explosives under different conditions. This program saved time
when planning for demolition training operations for my Marines. [💥](https://github.com/EvinRWatson/newCalc)

## Current Project 
What I am working on right now is a inventory and maintenance management software called [Dominion Provisioning](https://github.com/EvinRWatson/DominionProvisioning).
The inspiration for this project was to be a more intuitive and easy to use version of the Global Combat Support System, the logistics software used by the Army and
Marine Corps. 🤖

### Fun Fact 
The human brain takes in 11 million bits of information every second but is aware of only 40! 🤯
